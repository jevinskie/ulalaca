# NOTE

- **STILL IN HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE YET**
- This software requires [xrdp](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp) and [ulalaca-xrdp](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/ulalaca-xrdp) to be installed for work.
- This software uses [ScreenCaptureKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/screencapturekit) which introduced with macOS 12.3, so macOS 12.3 or higher version is required.
